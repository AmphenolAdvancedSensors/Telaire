/* Connection for T67xx UART is all the same. Module can take power from Arduino.
    T67xx   Arduino
     A  Tx   Pin 8 Rx
     B  Rx   Pin 9 Tx
     C       +5V
     2       Ground

Sketch uses serial window at 19200 baud with CR & LF enabled.
The sketch runs sensor for 5 minutes prior to requesting a calibration value and 
a single point recalibration routine.
Suggest module is in a stable environment to run this sketch to maximise accuracy,
eg outside at approx 25Â°C, set at 420ppm.

The sketch requires the AltSoftSerial library to be loaded.
